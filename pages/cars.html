                <h2>Red Bull Racing RB20</h2>
                <p>Red Bull Racing would appear to be sitting pretty after completing one of the most dominant season in
                    the
                    competition’s history (it won 20 of last year’s 22 grand prix). That didn’t stop the team from
                    trying to
                    iron out a few kinks with its 2024 car, RB 20. So far the early signs are good, with the car
                    performing
                    excellently in pre-season testing. It also helps that Red Bull still has three-time-defending
                    driver’s champ
                    Max Verstappen in one its cars (teammate Sergio Perez is no slouch, despite some of last season’s
                    struggles). The biggest question as the season starts is if the misconduct allegations surrounding
                    team
                    principal Christian Horner prove to be a distraction—which it almost certainly will, thanks to Max’s
                    father—even after team has cleared him of any wrongdoing.</p>

                <h2>Mercedes-AMG Petronas W15</h2>
                <p>After two years of spent dealing with serious design issues, Mercedes-AMG Petronas will hope they
                    finally
                    have things right this season. The new race car, W15, is a new concept and has performed well enough
                    in
                    testing. The team may have finished second last year, but we imagine principal Toto Wolff would love
                    to get
                    Lewis Hamilton his record-breaking eighth driver’s championship in his final season with the team
                    before
                    switching over to Ferrari. Mercedes’s other driver, George Russell, also wouldn’t mind a strong
                    season that
                    shows his team they’re still in good hands.</p>

                <p>Mercedes may feel like they’re on the right path, but there may be no team better equipped to catch
                    Red Bull
                    than Ferrari. The oldest and winningest team on the grid believes it has solved the pace, cornering,
                    and
                    tire-wear issues that plagued it last season with the new SF-24 car, and it would appear its drivers
                    Charles
                    Leclerc and Carlos Sainz agree. Still, it will be a strange year for Ferrari. Next year, the
                    legendary
                    Hamilton will join the team, displacing Sainz. We imagine the Spaniard wouldn’t mind using this
                    year’s grand
                    prix to remind the rest of the field of his worth.</p>

                <h2>McLaren MCL61</h2>
                <p>If any team is going to crack the front three’s grip on their spots this season, it’s most likely to
                    be
                    McLaren. Although last year’s car got off to a rough start, it was the second fastest behind only
                    Red Bull
                    down the stretch. Team principal Andrea Stella would like to build on this and will hope that the
                    lessons
                    learned from the team’s new wind tunnel can drive this year’s car, MCL38, to success. He’d love to
                    see
                    either (or both) Lando Norris or Oscar Piastri win their first race, especially since that will

                <h2>Aston Martin AMR24</h2>
                <p>Like McLaren, Aston Martin will be looking to build on the progress it made in 2023. This season’s
                    entry,
                    AMR24, is the first F1 car built at the automaker’s new AMF1 Technology Campus in Silverstone,
                    England.
                    Unless something has gone awry in the offseason—there were no signs of this in pre-season testing—it
                    should
                    be one of the more well-balanced (as well as one of the best-looking) cars on the grid. The team
                    remains
                    ever thankful to have Alonso in one of its driver seats, as the Spaniard gives it a chance at making

                <p>No one would call the buzz currently surrounding Alpine positive, but it’s hard to imagine things
                    going any
                    worse than last year. The 2023 season was one of disappointment for the team and culminated in the
                    July
                    firing of former team principal Otmar Szafnauer. His replacement, Bruno Famin, needs to find a way
                    to
                    reverse course. A new car, A524, was a bit sluggish in testing, but Famin can rely on a pair of
                    drivers in
                    Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon, who’ve already tasted race victory despite having spent their careers
                    racing

                    Williams. Team
                    principal James Vowles will be looking to build upon this in his second year in charge of the

                    one, but they’ll hope that their new car, FW46, and returning drivers Logan Sargeant (the

                <h2>Haas VF-24</h2>
                <p>New team principal Ayao Komatsu, who replaces Guenther Steiner, has a huge job on his hands. Last
                    season
                    couldn’t have gone worse for Haas, which spent the majority of its time ineffectually fighting
                    debilitating
                    tire-wear issues. The new car, VF-24, looks better equipped to finish races in 2024. Still, Komatsu
                    and
                    drivers Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hülkenberg will need to do more than that if they want to convince
                    team
                    owner Gene Haas that the team is making concrete progress.</p>
